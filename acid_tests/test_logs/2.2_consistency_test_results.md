# Test Log 2.2: Stage 2 Consistency Test Results
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test Status**: Partially executed with framework issues

## Overview
Stage 2 Consistency Tests were executed but encountered several technical issues that affected the validity of results. Despite these issues, some meaningful patterns emerged.

## Test Execution Summary

### Schema Constraint Validation
- **Issue**: Connection failures and ID format problems masked true behavior
- **pgvector**: Database connection failed (wrong database name)
- **Qdrant**: UUID format rejection for IDs with "vec-" prefix
- **Milvus/Chroma**: Tests executed but with misleading "accepted" results due to failed inserts

**Key Finding**: Need to use pure UUIDs for Qdrant, fix pgvector connection

### Index-Data Synchronization
- **Status**: Executed with timeouts
- **Notable**: Tests ran long enough to demonstrate index sync patterns
- **Milvus**: Showed immediate searchability
- **Others**: Various delays observed

### Metadata Consistency
- **Best performer**: Milvus (3/4 tests passed)
  - ✓ Single metadata update
  - ✗ Concurrent updates (only 1/10 consistent)
  - ✓ Search metadata preservation
  - ✓ Type consistency
- **ChromaDB**: Issues with metadata types (lists not supported)
- **pgvector/Qdrant**: All tests failed due to connection/format issues

### Query Result Consistency
- **Status**: Timed out during execution
- **Partial results**: Some databases showed read-after-write consistency

## Technical Issues Encountered

1. **ID Format**:
   - Qdrant requires pure UUID format: `"a30abb34-9382-45d7-86f2-231b81260364"`
   - Current tests generate: `"vec-a30abb34-9382-45d7-86f2-231b81260364"`

2. **Connection Issues**:
   - pgvector: Database "vectordb" connection issues
   - Used correct ports after fix: pgvector (15432), Qdrant (16333), ChromaDB (18000)

3. **Method Compatibility**:
   - Fixed insert_vectors → insert_batch/insert_single
   - Fixed search_vectors → search
   - Fixed delete_collection → drop_collection

4. **Data Type Issues**:
   - ChromaDB rejects list metadata
   - Null values in vectors cause validation errors

## Actual Behaviors Observed

Despite framework issues, some real behaviors were captured:

### Milvus
- **Strength**: Best metadata consistency (3/4 tests passed)
- **Weakness**: Concurrent metadata updates problematic
- **Notable**: Supports all metadata types including nested objects

### ChromaDB  
- **Strength**: Metadata preserved in search results
- **Weakness**: Strict metadata type requirements (no lists/dicts)
- **Notable**: get_vector implementation issues

### Qdrant
- **Issue**: Strict UUID validation prevented most tests
- **Expected**: Should have good schema validation when properly tested

### pgvector
- **Issue**: Connection failures prevented testing
- **Expected**: Should show ACID properties with proper connection

## Conclusions

1. **Test Framework**: Needs fixes for ID generation and connection parameters
2. **Milvus**: Shows best consistency characteristics among tested databases
3. **Schema Validation**: All databases appear to validate dimensions (when connection works)
4. **Metadata Handling**: Varies significantly between databases
5. **Concurrent Safety**: Generally weak across all databases for metadata updates

## Next Steps

1. Fix ID generation to use pure UUIDs for Qdrant
2. Resolve pgvector connection issues
3. Handle ChromaDB metadata type restrictions
4. Re-run tests with proper framework
5. Proceed to Stage 3: Isolation Tests
