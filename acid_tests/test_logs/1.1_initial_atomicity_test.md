# Test Log 01: Initial Atomicity Test
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test File**: `scenarios/test_atomicity_batch.py` (initial version)

## Objective
Implement and run Stage 1: Atomicity Tests according to acid_test_plan.md

## Test Design
- Insert 10,000 vectors with duplicate ID at position 5000
- Verify atomicity behavior of each database

## Issues Discovered
### 1. UUID Format Issue
- **Symptom**: "badly formed hexadecimal UUID string" errors in pgvector and Qdrant
- **Cause**: Using `vec-` prefix in IDs (`vec-uuid-string` format)
- **Impact**: 
  - pgvector: Entire batch rejected
  - Qdrant: Entire batch rejected
  - Testing input validation instead of true ACID behavior

### 2. Unexpected Milvus Behavior
- **Symptom**: All 10,000 vectors inserted successfully (despite duplicate ID)
- **Cause**: Milvus automatically handles duplicates without error
- **Impact**: Appears as ACID violation but is actually designed behavior

### 3. ChromaDB Metadata Issue
- **Symptom**: "Expected metadata value to be a str, int, float, bool, or None, got [...] which is a list"
- **Cause**: Using list type in metadata (`tags` field)

## Result Interpretation Problems
- pgvector/Qdrant/ChromaDB appear "atomic" (full rejection)
- But this is validation failure, not true atomicity
- Only Milvus showed different behavior than expected

## Lessons Learned
- Test data format significantly affects test results
- Need to understand each database's ID format requirements
- Must distinguish between input validation and true ACID behavior
