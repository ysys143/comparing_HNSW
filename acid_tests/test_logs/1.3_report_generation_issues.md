# Test Log 03: Report Generation Issues
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test Files**: `utils/report_generator.py`, `scenarios/test_atomicity_batch.py`

## Issues Identified
### 1. Empty results/reports directories
- **Problem**: Test results not being saved to files
- **Solution**: Added report generation calls to test script

### 2. Subjective recommendations in reports
- **Problem**: Reports included subjective judgments like "Financial/Medical AI"
- **User feedback**: Remove personal judgments, keep only technical observations
- **Solution**: Updated report generator to focus on technical characteristics

## Report Generator Updates
### Before (Subjective)
```markdown
**For Financial/Medical AI requiring strict consistency**:
- âœ… pgvector - Only database with proven transaction rollback
```

### After (Objective)
```markdown
**Transaction Support**:
- pgvector: Explicit SQL transactions with rollback capability
- Others: No transaction support (BASE model)
```

## Key Changes
1. Removed application-specific recommendations
2. Focus on observed technical behaviors
3. Present facts without judgment
4. Let users draw their own conclusions based on requirements

## Result
Reports now contain:
- Technical characteristics only
- Observed behaviors from tests
- No prescriptive recommendations
- Clear distinction between ACID and BASE models
