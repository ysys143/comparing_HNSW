# ACID Tests Implementation Summary
**Period**: 2025-06-23
**Total Iterations**: 5 major iterations

## Overview
Implemented Stage 1: Atomicity Tests from acid_test_plan.md for vector databases (pgvector, Qdrant, Milvus, ChromaDB).

## Key Learnings

### 1. Test Design Matters
- Initial tests failed due to ID format issues (UUID validation)
- This masked the real ACID vs BASE differences
- Solution: Use proper UUIDs and focus on behavior during partial failures

### 2. Database-Specific Behaviors
- **pgvector**: True transaction support with rollback
- **Qdrant**: Allows partial batch success (BASE behavior)
- **Milvus**: Automatic deduplication without errors
- **ChromaDB**: Strict validation but allows partial success with duplicates

### 3. Interpretation is Critical
- "Atomic-looking" behavior ≠ True atomicity
- Validation failures ≠ Transaction rollback
- Expected BASE behavior ≠ Test failure

### 4. Report Quality
- Users want objective technical observations
- No subjective recommendations
- Clear distinction between observed behavior and interpretation
