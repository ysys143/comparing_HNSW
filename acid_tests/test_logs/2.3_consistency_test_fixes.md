# Test Log 2.3: Consistency Test Fixes and Re-run
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Status**: Fixed major issues and re-ran tests

## Issues Fixed

### 1. pgvector Connection
- **Issue**: "database 'vectordb' does not exist" 
- **Fix**: Updated PgVectorClient to parse connection_string properly
- **Note**: Still getting password authentication failure

### 2. ID Generation for Qdrant
- **Issue**: Qdrant requires pure UUID format but tests used "initial-0", "update-1" etc.
- **Fix**: Updated DataGenerator to use pure UUIDs by default
- **Fix**: Modified test files to use `generate_vectors(count, prefix="xxx")` instead of overwriting IDs

### 3. Test Failure Handling
- **Issue**: Tests reported "✓ No stale reads" even when no vectors were inserted
- **Fix**: Added proper checks to verify vectors exist before testing deletion
- **Fix**: Changed status to "N/A" when insertion fails

### 4. Concurrent Client Usage
- **Verified**: Single client with async operations is correct approach
- Connection pooling handled internally by clients
- Matches real-world usage patterns

## Test Results After Fixes

### Milvus - Still Perfect (✓ 4/4)
- ✓ Perfect read-after-write consistency
- ✓ Stable results during updates  
- ✓ All concurrent reads identical
- ✓ No stale reads detected

### ChromaDB - Consistent (⚠ 3/4)
- ✓ Perfect read-after-write consistency
- ⚠ Moderate stability during updates
- ✓ All concurrent reads identical
- ✓ No stale reads detected

### pgvector - Connection Failed (0/1)
- Password authentication failed
- All tests failed due to no connection

### Qdrant - Still Failing (0/1) 
- Still getting "Unable to parse UUID" errors
- IDs are being generated as pure UUIDs but still prefixed somewhere

## Remaining Issues

1. **pgvector password**: Need correct password for connection
2. **Qdrant ID format**: Despite fixes, still generating non-UUID IDs
3. **Test validity**: Only Milvus and ChromaDB are producing valid results

## Conclusion

The test framework still has issues that prevent fair comparison across all databases. Only Milvus and ChromaDB are being properly tested, which makes the "perfect" Milvus results suspicious - it might just be the only one working correctly with the test framework.
