# Test Log 05: Report Format Fixes
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test File**: `utils/report_generator.py`

## Problem
User reported that Summary and Detailed Results sections were completely empty in generated reports.

## Root Cause
Report generator was looking for `batch_atomicity` key in results, but `test_atomicity_proper.py` uses different structure:
- pgvector: `transactional_atomicity`
- Others: `best_effort_behavior` and `partial_failure`

## Solution
Updated report generator to handle both result formats:

### Summary Section Fix
```python
# Handle proper atomicity test results
if 'transactional_atomicity' in db_results:
    # pgvector transaction test
elif 'best_effort_behavior' in db_results:
    # Other databases
elif 'batch_atomicity' in db_results:
    # Legacy format support
```

### Detailed Results Fix
Added specific handling for each test type:
- Transaction tests (pgvector)
- Best-effort tests (others)
- Partial failure tests
- Legacy batch atomicity tests

## Final Report Structure
```
## Summary
| Database | Test Type | Result | Details |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| pgvector | Transactional | ✅ PASS | 100 vectors rolled back |
| qdrant | Best-effort | ✅ BASE | 71/100 inserted |

## Detailed Results
### pgvector
#### Transaction Test
- Test type: SQL transaction with deliberate rollback
- Vectors in transaction: 100
- Rollback successful: True
```

## Result
Reports now properly display all test results with clear structure and complete information.
