# Test Log 04: Proper Atomicity Test Implementation
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test File**: `scenarios/test_atomicity_proper.py` (new implementation)

## Background
User pointed out that current tests don't align with acid_test_plan.md specifications:
- Plan specified testing "best-effort insert behavior" for non-transactional DBs
- Current tests were failing due to validation, not demonstrating partial success

## New Test Design
### 1. For pgvector (Transactional)
```python
async def test_transactional_atomicity_pgvector(client):
    # Test explicit SQL transaction with rollback
    async with client.connection.transaction():
        # Insert 100 vectors
        # Force rollback
    # Verify all vectors were rolled back
```

### 2. For Others (Best-Effort)
```python
async def test_best_effort_insert_behavior(db_name, client):
    # Create batch with invalid vector at position 50
    # Attempt insert
    # Check how many vectors were inserted before failure
```

## Key Results
### pgvector
- ✓ **Transaction rollback supported** - 100 vectors successfully rolled back
- True ACID compliance demonstrated

### Qdrant
- ✗ **No rollback (expected)** - BASE behavior confirmed
- Partial success: 71/100 vectors inserted (before invalid vector)
- Duplicate test: 99/100 inserted (duplicate skipped)

### Milvus
- N/A - Strict validation prevents partial insert test
- But duplicate handling shows 100/100 (automatic deduplication)

### ChromaDB
- ✗ **No rollback (expected)** - BASE behavior confirmed
- Dimension validation strict (0/100)
- But duplicate test: 99/100 inserted (duplicate skipped)

## Important Distinction
- ✗ doesn't mean failure - it means "no transaction support" which is **expected** for BASE systems
- This properly demonstrates the architectural difference between ACID and BASE models
