# Test Log 02: Milvus Behavior Investigation
**Date**: 2025-06-23
**Test File**: `scenarios/test_atomicity_batch.py` (updated version)

## Objective
Investigate why Milvus reported inserting all 10,000 vectors despite duplicate ID

## Investigation Method
Added Milvus-specific verification logic to test code:
```python
if db_name == 'milvus' and vectors_inserted > 0:
    # Check which version of duplicate ID was actually stored
    duplicate_id = vectors[4999].id
    vec_original = await client.get_vector(collection_name, duplicate_id)
    stored_index = vec_original.metadata.get('index', -1)
```

## Findings
### Milvus Duplicate Handling
- **Behavior**: First-write-wins (first write is retained)
- **Actual stored**: 9,999 vectors (1 duplicate excluded)
- **Errors**: None raised
- **Count reported**: 10,000 (bug or design?)

### Comparison with Other DBs
- **Qdrant/ChromaDB**: Reject entire batch on duplicate detection
- **Milvus**: Silently handles duplicates and continues

## Conclusion
- Milvus doesn't violate ACID, it has **automatic deduplication**
- This is a conflict resolution strategy in BASE model
- Designed behavior that can be useful in certain use cases

## Code Improvement
```python
elif db_name == 'milvus' and duplicate_behavior:
    print(f"   ⚠️  MILVUS UPSERT BEHAVIOR")
    print(f"   → No error on duplicate IDs")
    print(f"   → Duplicate handling: {duplicate_behavior}")
    print(f"   → This is NOT atomic rollback, but automatic deduplication")
```
