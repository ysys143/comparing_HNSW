- [x] milvus_analysis_plan.md (this document)

### Phase 2 Deliverables
- [ ] 02_architecture.md
- [ ] Service interaction diagrams
- [ ] Knowhere integration documentation

### Phase 3 Deliverables
- [ ] 03_algorithms/hnsw_knowhere.md

## Success Criteria

1. **Knowhere Understanding**: Complete analysis of vector index implementations
2. **Architecture Clarity**: Clear documentation of distributed architecture
3. **Performance Insights**: Identification of optimization strategies
4. **Integration Patterns**: Understanding Go-C++ interaction patterns

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity**: Focus on core vector operations first
2. **Language Boundary**: Understand CGO implications
3. **External Dependencies**: Document Knowhere as black box if needed
4. **Scope Management**: Prioritize HNSW and IVF implementations

## Timeline Summary

- **Total Estimated Time**: 11-16 days
- **Critical Path**: Knowhere analysis → Query execution → Distributed coordination
- **Checkpoints**: Daily progress reviews, phase-end summaries

## Special Considerations

1. **Knowhere Dependency**: Core algorithms are in external library
2. **Language Split**: Performance implications of Go-C++ boundary
3. **Cloud-Native Focus**: Kubernetes deployment assumptions
4. **GPU Support**: Optional but significant feature
