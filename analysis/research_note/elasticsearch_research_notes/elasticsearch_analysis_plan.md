## Success Criteria

1. **Understanding Lucene Integration**: Clear mapping of how Elasticsearch uses and extends Lucene
2. **Quantization Insights**: Detailed understanding of all quantization techniques
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Documentation of accuracy vs speed trade-offs
4. **Integration Patterns**: How vector search integrates with existing search features

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity**: Focus on vector-specific code paths
2. **Large Codebase**: Use targeted analysis with clear boundaries
3. **Lucene Dependencies**: Understand Lucene basics first
4. **Time Management**: Prioritize core vector functionality

## Timeline Summary

- **Total Estimated Time**: 11-16 days
- **Critical Path**: Vector codecs → Quantization → Search execution
- **Checkpoints**: Daily progress reviews, phase-end summaries

## Special Considerations

1. **Lucene Dependency**: Much of the HNSW implementation is in Lucene, not Elasticsearch
2. **Quantization Focus**: Elasticsearch's main innovation is in quantization techniques
3. **Integration Complexity**: Vector search is deeply integrated with text search
4. **Version Sensitivity**: Features vary significantly across versions
