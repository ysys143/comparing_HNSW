## Executive Summary

Vector search has become the core infrastructure for modern AI applications. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the importance of vector databases has surged in areas like semantic search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and recommendation systems. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm implementations in seven of the most widely used vector database systems, presenting their technical characteristics and practical considerations for deployment.

### Key Research Findings

The most significant finding of this study is that each vector database goes beyond a simple implementation of the HNSW algorithm. They have creatively adapted and optimized it to fit their unique architectures and target use cases. This diversity offers users a wealth of choices but also signifies that a deep understanding of each system's characteristics is necessary for making the right selection.

Implementation approaches can be broadly categorized into three types. **pgvector, Qdrant, Vespa, and Weaviate** have implemented HNSW natively, deeply integrating it into their systems. They have applied unique optimizations tailored to their architectures; for example, pgvector leverages PostgreSQL's page-based storage and MVCC, while Qdrant implements innovative filtering strategies based on Rust's memory safety. In contrast, **Chroma and Milvus** have chosen to wrap proven libraries (hnswlib, Knowhere) to ensure rapid development and stability. **Elasticsearch** has implemented HNSW within the Lucene framework, achieving seamless integration with the existing search engine ecosystem.

### Innovations in Performance and Efficiency

While all systems support hardware acceleration using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, there are significant differences in their implementation levels and approaches. **Weaviate** pursues maximum platform-specific performance through assembly-level optimizations, while **Vespa** maximizes compile-time optimizations with a template-based C++ implementation. Notably, **Qdrant and Milvus** support GPU acceleration, enabling breakthrough performance gains in large-scale vector operations.

In terms of memory management, each system showcases a unique approach. **Qdrant** significantly reduces memory usage by delta-encoding graph links, and **Vespa** ensures uninterrupted reads during updates via a Read-Copy-Update (RCU) mechanism. **pgvector** provides stable memory management by leveraging PostgreSQL's proven buffer cache system.

### Recommendations for Practical Application

The choice of technology should depend on the organization's situation and requirements. For organizations already using PostgreSQL, **pgvector** is the best choice. Its full SQL integration and ACID transaction support provide the simplest way to add vector search capabilities to existing applications. However, the inherent difficulty of horizontal scaling in PostgreSQL must be considered.

For most new projects, **Weaviate or Qdrant** are recommended. Both systems offer modern architectures, excellent performance, and a reasonable learning curve. **Qdrant**, in particular, delivers high performance even in resource-constrained environments due to its outstanding memory efficiency and innovative filtering strategies. **Weaviate** excels in developer experience with its GraphQL API and rich module ecosystem.

In large-scale enterprise environments, **Elasticsearch or Milvus** are suitable. **Elasticsearch** can meet complex search requirements with its mature distributed system and hybrid search (text + vector) capabilities. **Milvus** offers proven scalability to handle over a billion vectors and provides GPU acceleration.

If performance is the top priority and complexity is manageable, **Vespa** is the best choice. Developed and proven at scale by Yahoo, Vespa offers lock-free updates via RCU and top-tier query performance. However, its steep learning curve and complex setup are recommended only for teams with sufficient technical expertise.

### Future Outlook

The vector database market is evolving rapidly, with several clear trends emerging. GPU acceleration is gradually becoming a standard, and the adoption of the Rust language is growing to secure both memory safety and performance. The emergence of serverless vector search services is significantly reducing operational burdens, and the expansion into multi-modal search is creating new use cases.

Organizations must recognize that today's technology choices are not permanent and should be re-evaluated regularly. We hope that the analysis and recommendations presented in this report will help each organization select the vector database that best suits its needs.

## 1\. Introduction

### 1.1. Background and Objectives

Since the emergence of ChatGPT in 2022, vector databases have become a core component of AI infrastructure. As the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern has become the standard methodology for overcoming the limitations of LLMs, the importance of efficient and accurate vector search has become more critical than ever. In this context, the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm has become the de facto standard adopted by most production vector databases due to its excellent search performance and scalability.

However, each vector database has gone beyond a simple implementation of HNSW, uniquely modifying and optimizing it to fit their own architecture and target market. This provides users with a variety of options but also creates a complexity where a lack of precise understanding of each system's characteristics can lead to poor choices.

This study originates from this problem awareness and conducts an in-depth analysis of the HNSW implementations of the seven most widely used vector databases in the current market. Going beyond a simple feature comparison, we aimed to understand the implementation philosophy and technical trade-offs by directly analyzing the source code of each system. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide practical guidelines for practitioners to select the most suitable system for their requirements.

##### Neighbor Selection Algorithm

Each system applies different heuristics for neighbor selection, the core of HNSW:

**pgvector**: Simple pruning when the number of connections exceeds the limit.

```c
neighbors = HnswPruneConnections(neighbors, m);
```

**Qdrant**: Sophisticated heuristics with distance-based pruning.

```rust
fn select_neighbors_heuristic(&self, candidates: &[ScoredPoint], m: usize) {
    // Check if a candidate improves connectivity
    for &existing in &result {
        if distance_to_existing < current.score {
            good = false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Vespa**: Template-based with configurable heuristics.

```cpp
if (_cfg.heuristic_select_neighbors()) {
    return select_neighbors_heuristic(neighbors, max_links);
}
```

**Weaviate**: Heuristics with candidate extension.

```go
if h.extendCandidates {
    // Consider neighbors of neighbors
}
```

#### 2.1.2. Graph Construction Parameters

The `M` and `efConstruction` parameters, which determine the graph's structure, directly impact search performance and quality.

| System          | Default M | Default efConstruction | Max M       | Dynamic Tuning |

| **Vespa** | RCU (Read-Copy-Update)    | Lock-free reads           | `vespalib::GenerationHandler`, `std::memory_order_release`  |
| **Weaviate** | Multiple specialized locks| Per-operation             | `sync.RWMutex` for cache/node/tombstone                   |
| **Elasticsearch** | Java `synchronized`       | Segment-level             | `synchronized` blocks, `ReentrantReadWriteLock`             |
| **Milvus** | `std::shared_mutex`       | Component-level           | Reader-writer locks for concurrent search                   |

##### Concurrent Operation Example

**Vespa (RCU)**:

```cpp
PreparedAddNode prepare_add_document(uint32_t docid, VectorBundle vectors) {
    auto guard = _graph.node_refs_size.getGuard();
    // Prepare without locks
}

void complete_add_document(PreparedAddNode prepared) {
    // Atomic commit
}
```

**Weaviate (Granular Locking)**:

```go
deleteLock      sync.Mutex      // for deletes
tombstoneLock   sync.RWMutex    // for tombstone access
insertLock      sync.RWMutex    // for inserts
```

#### 2.1.5. Search Algorithm Variations

##### Early Termination Conditions

Each system implements different early termination strategies for search efficiency:

**pgvector**:

```c
if (lc->distance > GetFurthestDistance(w))
    break;
```

**Qdrant**:

```rust
if current.score > w.peek().unwrap().score {
    break;
}
```

**Vespa**:

```cpp
// Doom-based cancellation
if (doom.is_doomed()) {
    return partial_results;
}
```

##### Dynamic Parameter Adjustment

**Qdrant**:

```rust
// Auto ef based on result quality
ef = max(k * 2, min_ef);
```

**Weaviate**:

```go
// Auto-tuning ef
ef = h.autoEfMin + int(float32(k-h.autoEfMin)*h.autoEfFactor)
```

#### 2.1.6. Persistence and Recovery

##### Durability Mechanism Comparison

| System          | Persistence Method   | Recovery Support   | Crash Safety                  |

| **Milvus** | Object Storage       | Binlog replay      | S3/MinIO with segment sealing |

### 2.2. Filtering Strategy Comparison

The method of combining metadata filtering with vector search is a crucial factor determining the system's performance and flexibility.

#### 2.2.1. Filtering Approaches

| System          | Pre-filtering | Post-filtering | Hybrid | Dynamic Selection        |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| **pgvector** | ❌            | ✅             | ❌     | ❌                       |
| **Chroma** | ✅            | ✅             | ✅     | ✅ (heuristic-based)     |
| **Elasticsearch** | ✅            | ❌             | ❌     | ❌                       |

##### Three Approaches to Filtering Strategy

1.  **Pre-filtering (Filter-then-Search)**

      * Applies the filter first, then searches within the filtered set.
      * Efficient for high-selectivity filters.
      * Risk of graph area disconnection.

2.  **Post-filtering (Search-then-Filter)**

      * Performs vector search first, then applies the filter.
      * Simple implementation but potentially inefficient.
      * May require oversampling.

3.  **Hybrid/Adaptive Approach**

      * Dynamically chooses between strategies.
      * Based on estimating filter selectivity.
      * Optimal performance in various scenarios.

##### Advanced Filtering Implementations by System

**Qdrant: Statistical Cardinality Estimation**

```rust

##### Detailed Analysis of Quantization Techniques

**pgvector: Type-based Quantization**

  - **halfvec**: 16-bit half-precision floating-point (50% memory reduction).
  - **bit**: Binary vectors for Hamming distance (96.875% memory reduction).
  - **sparsevec**: Sparse vector representation for high-dimensional sparse data.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
-- Half-precision vector
CREATE TABLE items (embedding halfvec(768));
CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding halfvec_l2_ops);

-- Binary vector
CREATE TABLE binary_items (embedding bit(768));
CREATE INDEX ON binary_items USING hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);
```

**Qdrant: Comprehensive Quantization Suite**

```rust
pub enum QuantizationConfig {
    Scalar(ScalarQuantization),
    Product(ProductQuantization),
    Binary(BinaryQuantization),
}

impl ScalarQuantizer {
    pub fn quantize(&self, vector: &[f32]) -> Vec<u8> {
        let (min, max) = self.compute_bounds(vector);
        let scale = 255.0 / (max - min);
        
        vector.iter()
            .map(|&v| {
                let normalized = (v - min) * scale;
                normalized.round().clamp(0.0, 255.0) as u8
            })
            .collect()
    }
}
```

**Elasticsearch: Advanced Quantization Engine**

Optimized Scalar Quantization (OSQ):

  - Advanced mathematical optimization by minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  - Adaptive bit allocation (1, 4, 7, 8 bits).
  - Use of confidence intervals for dynamic range adaptation.

<!-- end list -->

```java
public class OptimizedScalarQuantizer {
    private final int bits; // 1, 4, 7, 8 bits supported
    
    // Optimized grid points via MSE minimization
    public void calculateOSQGridPoints(float[] target, float[] interval, int points, float invStep, float[] pts) {
        // SIMD optimized calculation for minimum reconstruction error
        FloatVector daaVec = FloatVector.zero(FLOAT_SPECIES);
        FloatVector dabVec = FloatVector.zero(FLOAT_SPECIES);
        // ...
    }
}
```

Int7 Special Optimization:

  - A special 7-bit quantization that removes the sign bit.
  - Utilizes highly efficient unsigned 8-bit SIMD instructions.

Binary Quantization (BBQ):

  - Advanced 1-bit quantization using complex correction terms to preserve accuracy.
  - Achieves up to 32x compression.

class IVFSQ : public IVF {
    struct SQQuantizer {
        void train(const float* data, size_t n, size_t d) {
            #pragma omp parallel for
            for (size_t i = 0; i < d; i++) {
                for (size_t j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    float val = data[j * d + i];
                    trained_min[i] = std::min(trained_min[i], val);
                    trained_max[i] = std::max(trained_max[i], val);
                }
            }
        }
    };
};

// GPU-accelerated CUDA implementation
__global__ void scalar_quantize_kernel(
    const float* input, uint8_t* output,
    const float* scales, const float* offsets,
    int n, int d) {
    
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx >= n * d) return;
    
    int dim = idx % d;
    float normalized = (input[idx] - offsets[dim]) * scales[dim];
    int quantized = __float2int_rn(normalized * 255.0f);
    output[idx] = static_cast<uint8_t>(max(0, min(255, quantized)));
}
```

| Product (m=16)  | 85-92%    | 8-15x | 6%     |
| Binary          | 70-85%    | 20-50x| 3%     |

##### Advanced Quantization Features

**Qdrant: Oversampling and Rescoring**

```rust
pub struct QuantizedSearch {
    oversampling_factor: f32,
    rescore_with_original: bool,
}

impl QuantizedSearch {
    pub fn search(&self, query: &[f32], k: usize) -> Vec<ScoredPoint> {
        // Search with oversampling
        let oversample_k = (k as f32 * self.oversampling_factor) as usize;
        let candidates = self.quantized_search(query, oversample_k);
        
        if self.rescore_with_original {
            // Rescore top candidates with original vectors
            self.rescore_candidates(candidates, query, k)
        } else {
            candidates.into_iter().take(k).collect()
        }
    }
}
```

**Milvus: Hybrid Quantization**

```cpp
// Combination of coarse and fine quantization
class HybridQuantizer {
    std::unique_ptr<CoarseQuantizer> coarse_;
    std::unique_ptr<ProductQuantizer> fine_;
    
public:
    void Encode(const float* vec, uint8_t* code) {
        // First level: coarse quantization
        int cluster_id = coarse_->FindNearestCluster(vec);
        
        // Second level: product quantization of the residual
        float* residual = ComputeResidual(vec, cluster_id);
        fine_->Encode(residual, code + sizeof(int));
        
        // Store cluster ID
        memcpy(code, &cluster_id, sizeof(int));
    }
};
```

##### Quantization Selection Guide

```python
def select_quantization(dimensions, num_vectors, recall_requirement):
    if recall_requirement > 0.98:
        return None  # No quantization
    elif dimensions < 128 and recall_requirement > 0.95:
        return "scalar"
    elif num_vectors > 1_000_000:
        return "product"
    elif dimensions > 1000:
        return "binary"
    else:
        return "scalar"
```

### 2.5. Unique Algorithmic Innovations

Each system has achieved original algorithmic innovations beyond HNSW.

  * **Vespa: 2-Phase Search & Generation-based Concurrency**: In the first phase, HNSW finds an approximate candidate set, and in the second phase, it is accurately re-ranked with the original vectors to maximize recall. Additionally, generation-based concurrency control (RCU) ensures high search throughput even during writes by not using locks for read operations.

  * **Weaviate: Dynamic Cleanup & LSMKV Store**: Dynamically cleans up connections of deleted nodes during searches to maintain graph quality. Its self-developed LSMKV (Log-Structured Merge-Key-Value) storage engine achieves both durability and efficient updates.

  * **Qdrant: Visited List Pooling**: Manages a pool of reusable `VisitedList` objects that store lists of visited nodes during a search, significantly reducing the overhead associated with memory allocation/deallocation and improving search speed.

  * **Milvus: GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes CUDA to perform index construction and search on the GPU. It shows performance improvements of tens of times compared to CPU for large datasets.

### 3\. Architecture Comparative Analysis

Each vector database is built on a different design philosophy, which determines the fundamental characteristics of the system, such as storage, scalability, and operational methods.

#### Classification by Architecture Type

System architectures can be broadly classified into four types.

  * **Database Extension**: **pgvector** is a prime example. It is added as an extension to an existing PostgreSQL, inheriting all the features of the host database (transactions, backup, security). It is stable and predictable but is constrained by the host's single-node architecture.
  * **Standalone Server**: **Qdrant** and **Chroma** fall into this category. They operate as independent servers optimized for vector search and have their own storage and clustering capabilities. Qdrant, in particular, maximizes performance and memory efficiency with its Rust-based implementation.
  * **Distributed System**: **Milvus**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Vespa** were designed from the ground up for large-scale distributed environments.
      * **Milvus** adopts a microservices architecture, a cloud-native structure where each component can be scaled independently.
      * **Elasticsearch** applies its shard-based distributed processing model to vector search, leveraging the scalability of its existing search engine.
      * **Vespa** has a container-based architecture for large-scale real-time serving, where content nodes and container nodes are separated to support concurrent indexing and searching.
  * **Schema-based**: **Weaviate** has a unique architecture that operates around a schema. Its GraphQL API and module system allow for flexible feature extension, emphasizing the importance of data modeling.

| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **pgvector** | SQL                   | PostgreSQL Wire       | Declarative         |
| **Chroma** | Python/REST           | HTTP/gRPC             | Object-oriented     |
| **Elasticsearch** | REST                  | HTTP                  | RESTful             |
| **Vespa** | REST/Document/YQL     | HTTP                  | Document-oriented   |
| **Weaviate** | REST/GraphQL/gRPC     | HTTP/gRPC             | Graph/Resource      |
| **Qdrant** | REST/gRPC             | HTTP/gRPC             | Resource-oriented   |
| **Milvus** | gRPC                  | gRPC                  | RPC-based           |

  * **SQL (pgvector)**: Provides the most familiar interface for developers already using PostgreSQL. It allows leveraging the declarative nature and rich functionality of SQL, making it very powerful for handling relational and vector data together.
  * **GraphQL (Weaviate)**: Weaviate's adoption of GraphQL allows for requesting exactly the data needed, resulting in high network efficiency and the ability to intuitively explore complex object relationships. It is particularly useful when dealing with graph-structured data.
  * **REST/gRPC (Qdrant, Milvus, Elasticsearch, etc.)**: A standard approach supported by most modern systems. Qdrant and Milvus offer both gRPC for performance-critical communication and REST for universal access, enhancing flexibility.
  * **Proprietary Query Language (Vespa)**: Vespa's YQL (Vespa Query Language) is a powerful language designed to express complex ranking logic and multi-stage searches. It has a steep learning curve but offers almost limitless expressiveness.

#### Representative Query Examples

**pgvector (SQL)**: Naturally combines relational data and vectors within SQL.

```sql
SELECT id, metadata, embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance
FROM items
WHERE category = 'electronics' AND price < 1000
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]'
LIMIT 10;
```

**Weaviate (GraphQL)**: Enables efficient communication by explicitly requesting required data fields.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Product(
      nearVector: { vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] },
      where: {
        path: ["price"],
        operator: LessThan,
        valueNumber: 1000
      },
      limit: 10
    ) {
      name
      _additional { distance }
    }
  }
}
```

**Qdrant (REST API)**: Defines search conditions in detail via a JSON object.

```json
POST /collections/products/points/search
{
  "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      { "key": "price", "range": { "lt": 1000 } }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 10,
  "with_payload": true
}
```

*(\*via PostgreSQL)*

#### Kubernetes Deployment Complexity Example

**Simple Deployment (Qdrant)**: Can be deployed simply with a basic StatefulSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: qdrant
spec:
  serviceName: qdrant
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: qdrant
        image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6333
```

**Complex Production Deployment (Elasticsearch)**: Uses a dedicated operator (ECK), with many considerations such as master/data node role separation and resource configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: production-cluster
spec:
  version: 8.16.0
  nodeSets:
  - name: masters
    count: 3
    config:
      node.roles: ["master"]
  - name: data
    count: 5
    config:
      node.roles: ["data", "ingest"]
    volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: elasticsearch-data
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Ti
```

## 5\. Ecosystem and Integration

### Ecosystem and Integration

In modern application development, the ease of integration with other tools is crucial. In particular, integration with LLM frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex greatly enhances the utility of a vector database.

#### Machine Learning Framework Support

| System          | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Hugging Face | LangChain | LlamaIndex |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| **pgvector** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Chroma** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Elasticsearch** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Vespa** | ✅      | ✅         | Limited      | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Weaviate** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Qdrant** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |
| **Milvus** | ✅      | ✅         | ✅           | ✅        | ✅         |

#### Embedding Model Integration Methods

**Native Integration (Weaviate)**: Weaviate can automatically perform vectorization upon data insertion through modules like `text2vec-openai`.

```json
{
  "class": "Product",
  "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai",
  "moduleConfig": {
    "text2vec-openai": {
      "model": "text-embedding-ada-002"
    }
  }
}
```

**External Embedding (Qdrant)**: The method used by most systems, where embeddings are generated externally and then inserted into the database.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
client = QdrantClient()
embeddings = model.encode(["My product description"])
client.upsert(collection_name="products", points=[...])
```

Most major systems (pgvector, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, Elasticsearch, Chroma) officially support LangChain and LlamaIndex, facilitating RAG application development. In particular, pgvector and Elasticsearch have the advantage of having mature ecosystems with stable client libraries available in almost all languages and frameworks.

**Streaming Ingestion (Elasticsearch + Kafka)**:

```json
// Kafka Connect configuration
{
  "name": "elasticsearch-sink",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
    "topics": "product-embeddings",
    "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
    "transforms": "vectorTransform",
    "transforms.vectorTransform.type": "com.custom.VectorTransform"
  }
}
```

**Batch Processing (Milvus + Spark)**:

```python
def process_batch(partition):
    connections.connect(host='localhost', port='19530')
    collection = Collection('products')
    
    entities = []
    for row in partition:
        entities.append({
            'id': row['id'],
            'embedding': row['embedding'],
            'metadata': row['metadata']
        })
    
    collection.insert(entities)

# Spark processing
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MilvusIngestion").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/embeddings/")
df.foreachPartition(process_batch)
```

## 6\. Operations and Deployment

A successful system adoption depends not only on the technical excellence of the technology itself but also on its integration with existing infrastructure, ease of operation, and the maturity of the community and ecosystem available for support when problems arise.

### Cloud Support and Deployment Options

Each system supports various cloud environments and deployment strategies.

| System          | Native Cloud Service                | Kubernetes Operator        | Deployment Complexity |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **pgvector** | ✅ (AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, etc.)   | ✅ (PostgreSQL Operator)   | Low                   |
| **Chroma** | ✅ (Chroma Cloud)                   | ❌                         | Very Low              |
| **Elasticsearch** | ✅ (Elastic Cloud)                  | ✅ (ECK)                   | High                  |
| **Vespa** | ✅ (Vespa Cloud)                    | ❌                         | High                  |
| **Weaviate** | ✅ (WCS)                            | ✅                         | Medium                |
| **Qdrant** | ✅ (Qdrant Cloud)                   | ❌                         | Low                   |
| **Milvus** | ✅ (Zilliz Cloud)                   | ✅                         | High                  |

  * **Most Mature Cloud Integration**: **Elasticsearch** and **pgvector** stand out. Elasticsearch offers a full suite of features like auto-scaling and automatic backups through its self-managed service, Elastic Cloud. pgvector can leverage the managed PostgreSQL services of major cloud providers like AWS RDS and GCP Cloud SQL, offering high stability and convenience.
  * **Modern Managed Services**: Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, Chroma, and Vespa also offer their own managed cloud services such as Zilliz Cloud, Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS), and Qdrant Cloud, reducing the operational burden on users.
  * **Deployment Complexity**: **Qdrant** and **Chroma** are very simple to deploy as single binaries. In contrast, **Elasticsearch**, **Vespa**, and **Milvus** are complex distributed systems composed of multiple components, and it is recommended to use a dedicated Operator in a Kubernetes environment.

### Data Pipelines and Monitoring

From data ingestion to system health management, integration with various tools is essential.

  * **Data Pipelines**: **Elasticsearch** and **Milvus** support integration with almost all major data processing platforms like Kafka, Spark, and Flink. **pgvector** demonstrates strong connectivity through the rich connector ecosystem of PostgreSQL.
  * **Monitoring and Observability**: With the exception of Chroma, most systems provide a **Prometheus** metrics endpoint by default, facilitating visualization through Grafana. **Elasticsearch**, in particular, offers the most comprehensive observability solution with its own APM and Kibana dashboards.

### Security and Enterprise Features

In production environments, security and regulatory compliance are crucial.

| Feature               | pgvector | Chroma | Elasticsearch | Vespa | Weaviate | Qdrant | Milvus |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| **TLS/SSL** | ✅       | ✅     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | ✅     | ✅     |
| **RBAC** | ✅\* | ❌     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | ✅     | ✅     |
| **API Keys** | ✅\* | ✅     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | ✅     | ✅     |
| **Encryption at Rest**| ✅\* | ❌     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | ✅     | ✅     |
| **Audit Logging** | ✅\* | ❌     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | Limited| ✅     |
| **LDAP/AD** | ✅\* | ❌     | ✅            | ✅    | ✅       | ❌     | ✅     |

*(\*via PostgreSQL)*

  * **Enterprise-Grade Security**: **Elasticsearch** is best suited for enterprise environments, having obtained the most regulatory compliance certifications such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA. **pgvector** inherits the robust security features of PostgreSQL, fully supporting RBAC, Row-Level Security (RLS), and audit logging.
  * **Growing Systems**: Weaviate, Qdrant, and Milvus also have most essential security features like RBAC, API keys, and encryption, and are rapidly expanding their regulatory compliance scope.
  * **Prototype Level**: **Chroma** currently has very limited security features, so it is safest to use it only for prototyping within a trusted network.

### Module and Extensibility Architecture

The way a system extends its functionality is an important indicator of its architectural design philosophy.

| System          | Extensibility Model                 | Examples                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **pgvector** | PostgreSQL Extension (C API, SQL)   | PostGIS integration, custom data types  |
| **Chroma** | Python Plugins (Embedders, Stores)  | OpenAI, Cohere embedders                |
| **Elasticsearch** | Java Plugin Framework (SPI)         | Language analyzers, custom scorers      |
| **Vespa** | Component System (Java/C++)         | Searcher, Document Processor chains     |
| **Weaviate** | Module Ecosystem (Go Interfaces)    | `text2vec-*`, `generative-*`, `qna-*` modules |
| **Qdrant** | gRPC hooks, custom scorers (planned)| Extensibility in early stages           |
| **Milvus** | Index Plugins (C++ Interfaces)      | GPU indexes, DiskANN, etc.              |

  * **Module-First Design (Weaviate)**: Weaviate is designed to allow users to combine features as needed by separating core functionalities (vectorization, Q\&A, generation) into independent modules. This provides clear separation of concerns and high flexibility.
  * **Powerful Plugin Systems (Elasticsearch, Vespa)**: Elasticsearch and Vespa have powerful plugin architectures based on Java and C++, respectively, allowing deep control and extension of the system's internal behavior. This is advantageous for implementing performance-sensitive custom logic but comes with high complexity.
  * **Stable Extension Model (pgvector)**: pgvector follows PostgreSQL's proven extension mechanism. While extensibility is somewhat limited, it guarantees C-level performance and stability.

The vector database market is evolving rapidly along with the swift advancement of AI technology. This section presents the trends and future outlook observed through this study.

#### Technological Advancement Directions

**1. Universal Hardware Acceleration**

While currently only Milvus and Qdrant support GPU acceleration, it is expected that all major vector databases will add GPU support in the future. Furthermore, the emergence of dedicated hardware for vector operations (NPUs, variations of TPUs) is anticipated. New SIMD instruction sets like Intel's AVX-512 VNNI and ARM's SVE2 will also significantly improve vector search performance.

**2. Evolution of Memory Hierarchy**

Systems will emerge that move beyond the current RAM-centric architecture to utilize new memory technologies such as persistent memory (Intel Optane) and CXL (Compute Express Link). This will significantly lower the cost of large-scale vector databases while maintaining performance.

**3. Continuous Improvement of Algorithms**

New ANN algorithms beyond HNSW are continuously being researched. Particularly, learned indexes and search utilizing graph neural networks are gaining attention. Existing systems are expected to quickly adopt these new algorithms.

#### Market Trend Predictions

**1. Consolidation and Standardization**

Although each vector database currently offers its own proprietary API, an industry standard is likely to emerge in the future. Candidates include vector extensions to SQL and standardized vector queries in GraphQL. This will reduce vendor lock-in and facilitate migration.

**2. Serverless and Edge Computing**

Serverless vector search services like Weaviate Cloud and Qdrant Cloud will become more widespread. Simultaneously, the demand for lightweight vector search engines that can run on edge devices will increase. This will be important for meeting privacy and latency requirements.

**3. Mainstreaming of Multi-Modal Search**

Multi-modal systems that can search text, images, audio, and video in an integrated manner will become the standard. Vespa is already moving in this direction, and other systems are expected to follow suit quickly.

#### Strategic Recommendations for Organizations

**1. Phased Approach Strategy**

Most organizations will likely follow a path starting with Chroma or pgvector, and as requirements grow, migrate to Weaviate, Qdrant, and eventually to Milvus or Vespa. It is wiser to choose a system that fits current requirements and migrate with growth, rather than choosing a complex system from the start.

**2. Consider a Hybrid Architecture**

Instead of trying to meet all requirements with a single vector database, consider a hybrid approach that uses different systems for different purposes. For example, using pgvector for transaction-critical parts, Milvus for large-scale analytics, and Qdrant for real-time search.

**3. Continuous Re-evaluation**

The vector database market is changing very rapidly. It is necessary to re-evaluate the technology stack every six months and review whether new features or performance improvements could have a significant impact on the business.

### Closing Remarks

This study has confirmed that each vector database has uniquely implemented the HNSW algorithm according to its own philosophy and goals. This diversity offers users a wealth of choices but also demands careful evaluation and selection.

There is no perfect vector database. Each system has chosen specific trade-offs, and the optimal choice depends on the organization's specific requirements, technical capabilities, and future plans. We hope that the analysis and guidelines presented in this report will be of practical help to each organization in selecting the most suitable vector database for them.

Vector search technology will continue to evolve as the core infrastructure of the AI era. We encourage you to maintain a competitive edge in this rapidly changing field through continuous learning and adaptation.
